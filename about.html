        <h1>About The Designer</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Corbyn. I am a 15 year old male high school junior in CT and I also take early college classes.
            I suffer from ADHD and SPD, and dissociative amnesia.
            I enjoy playing volleyball, painting, crocheting, diamond painting, listening to music, sparring, etc. My favorite video game is 'Grounded.'
        </p>
        
        <h2>My definition of "games"</h2>
<p>
  My definition of a game is "an online or offline activity to relieve stress." I personally believe that most, or all games, should at the very least be stress relieving.

  <h3>My gamer "type(s)" by the Bartle Test"</h3>
  <p>
    According to the Bartle Test, I am:
    
    <ol>
      <li>87% Explorer</li>
      <li>53% Achiever</li>
      <li>47% Killer</li>
      <li>13% Socialiser</li>
      </ol>
      
      I interpret the aforementioned data slightly different than as it appears, as when this test was taken, I solely thought of my favorite game. In this game, to kill is to achieve, and to explore is to kill.
        For example, in Grounded, to obtain a tier II axe I'd need to kill stinkbugs, meaning I need to explore the haze biome of the map and kill whatever poses as a threat to my goal.
        
      While I enjoy playing with other people, I often find myself in a position where I am the only person willing to play. My desires and goals for the game vary when I play with other people.
      </p>
      
      <h3>My favorite games</h3>
