<h1>Designer Mission</h1>
<p>
The mission I aim to achieve with my game is to challenge people who, like myself, are on the spectrum.
    I want to create something that will create great struggle if you don't take it step by step, something like Grounded, where you cannot take shortcuts.
    In addition I want this game to be fun and push the player to generate their own creative ideas in this sandbox-type game.
