  <h1>My Mission</h1>
  <p>The mission I aim to achieve with my game is to challenge people who, like myself, are on the spectrum.
    I want to create something that will create great struggle if you don't take it step by step, something like Grounded, where you cannot take shortcuts.
    In addition I want this game to be fun
